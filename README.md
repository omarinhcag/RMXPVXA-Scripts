# RMXPVXA-Scripts
Common repository for all of my RPG Maker scripts for XP, VX and VXAce. AND MV. AND MZ now. Compatibility varies from script to script.

## How do I know which one is from what RPG Maker?

Most XP, VX and Ace scripts say at the first couple lines. Sadly I'm not using any naming convention there, sorry.

As for MV and MZ... 
- MV has OZ. 
- MZ has OZZ.
