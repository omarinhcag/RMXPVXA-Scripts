# RMXPVXA-Scripts
Common repository for all of my RPG Maker scripts for XP, VX and VXAce. AND MV. AND MZ now. Compatibility varies from script to script.

## How do I know which one is from what RPG Maker?

XP, VX and Ace scripts start with a tag which denotes what RPG Maker version they are for (i.e. \[XP\]).

As for MV and MZ... 
- MV has OZ. 
- MZ has OZZ.
